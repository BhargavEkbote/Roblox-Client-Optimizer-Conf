# Roblox-Client-Optimizer-Conf
Roblox Client Optimizer without all the extra bullshit, with some extra tweaks added. FPS cap is increased to 42255 (basically infinite) and textures still load regardless if you delete your textures or not, if you want textures to NOT load then change FFlagDebugDisableOTAMaterialTexture from false to true.

This can work optimally if you have all your textures deleted except water, sky and glass. Even if you keep your textures the file still works but it will take more steps to enable low-poly.

Installation Instructions:
1. Windows Key + R
2. Paste this path: %appdata%\local\Roblox\Versions\
3. Click the top option.
4. Create a folder named "ClientSettings".
5. Paste the ClientAppSettings.json file from this repo into the folder you just created.
